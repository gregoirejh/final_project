### Pages

Across this project, you can access to different pages:

  - /Login : allows the user to login in order to access to his metrics
  - /signin : allows the user to create an account

## ðŸ›  Testing

Only critical parts of the code have been tested (users-related and metrics-related actions). We have been using [ShouldJS](https://shouldjs.github.io/) for expectations and [SinonJS](http://sinonjs.org/) for mocking.

## ðŸš€ CI

Our CI relies on Travis that runs all the tests.
